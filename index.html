	<h2>About me</h2>

		<p>My name is Kenny Chhoeun and I am 21 years old. Currently I'm studying the 3rd year of Computer Science<br> degree at California State Polytechnic University in Pomona. I'm interested in subjects like machine learning, AI, software engineering,<br> web and software development, and Unix-like environments. I'm a very curious and self-taught person who likes reading about new tools<br> and technologies. I like to propose efficient solutions to improve any type of process and thus offer final products of high quality.</p>
