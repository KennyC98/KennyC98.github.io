	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>My name is Kenny Chhoeun and I am 21 years old. Currently I'm studying the 3rd year of Computer Science degree at California State Polytechnic University in Pomona. I'm interested in subjects like machine learning, AI, software engineering, web and software development, and Unix-like environments. I'm a very curious and self-taught person who likes reading about new tools and technologies. I like to propose efficient solutions to improve any type of process and thus offer final products of high quality.</p>
